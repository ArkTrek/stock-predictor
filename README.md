# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

## Overview

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook designed for training a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict stock market prices. The model is trained using historical stock data and can be used to make predictions for future stock prices.

## Features

- **Training the Model:** Trains an LSTM model using historical stock price data.
- **Prediction:** Uses the trained model to predict future stock prices based on recent data.
- **Visualization:** Plots the actual and predicted stock prices for easy analysis.

## Requirements

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install yfinance numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow joblib
